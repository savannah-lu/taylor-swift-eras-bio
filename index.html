          After signing with the then-start-up label Big Machine Records, Taylor
          released her first album, a self-titled country record, with notable
          hits such as <em>Tim McGraw</em>, <em>Our Song</em>, and
          <em>Teardrops On My Guitar</em>. Taylor aimed to bring a younger
          audience to country music, as opposed to the middle-aged demographic
          label executives were looking for.

          <em>Speak Now</em> is Taylor's last album that is primarily country,
          and is one she wrote entirely herself. On the album's 17 tracks, she
          reflects on past relationships ("Back to December", "Dear John") and
          experiences ("Innocent"), the woes of growing older ("Never Grow Up"),
          as well as imagined scenarios she'd always been intrigued by ("Speak
          Now"). As of writing, it is rumored to be the next re-recorded album
          to be released.

          Released in October 2012, <em>Red</em> bridged the gap between
          Taylor's country roots to mainstream pop. It also marked the beginning
          of a more mature sound from Taylor as she mourns love found and lost
          in tracks like "All Too Well", and she explores new themes such as the
          pressure and dangers of stardom. In November 2021, she re-recorded and
          released <em> Red (Taylor's Version)</em> with 9 previously unreleased
          tracks, including the highly anticipated 10-minute-long unabridged
          version of <em>All Too Well</em>.

          Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, <em>1989</em> solidified Taylor's status
          as a mainstream pop artist. She recruited two popular producers at the
          time, Max Martin and Shellback, to help push her ideas in a different
          direction and ensure a smooth transition to pop. The album won two
          Grammys and was a commercial success, but with it came more scrutiny
          on her private life.

          <em>reputation</em> is Taylor's sixth and final album released under
          Big Machine Records. It was written and recorded during her hiatus
          from the spotlight, after various controversies and intense media
          scrutiny led her to make almost no public appearances for over a year.
          The album is primarily made up of two parts: one about revenge and
          taking back her public image, and the other of finding love during the
          darkest of times. She then embarked on the
          <em>Reputation Stadium Tour</em>, which currently holds the record for
          the highest-grossing tour in North America.

          <em>Lover</em>, Taylor's third pop album and seventh overall, does a
          complete 180 from the dark tone of <em>reputation</em>. With the help
          of longtime friend and producer Jack Antonoff (and others), she
          incorporates more of a subdued and bubblegum pop sound in the album
          she describes as "a love letter to love". The album's inspiration
          comes from a renewed sense of freedom, in both her personal life and

          quarantine. It was released in July 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic,
          and featured a collection of stories and songs, both real and
          imagined. <i>People</i> magazine described it as "a record to match

          Album Of The Year.

          Five months after the release of record-breaking album

          Swifties nicknamed it "the forgotten album" due to minimal promotion

          <i>evermore</i> continues <i>folklore</i>'s cozy, cottage-core theme
          and features collaborators Bon Iver, Haim, and the National. It tells
          stories of con artists falling in love, the dangers of daydreaming,

          the album's release in a TikTok series
